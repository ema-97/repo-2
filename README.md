# repo-2
Module 1 - code refactor lesson

## Installation
In the challenge I had to correct code errors such as semantics, broken links, formatting etc. By doing this  it allowed me to improve the general code and clean up the current file structure. Towards the end, I did fall into some trouble and didn't know how to correct my mistake, as you will see on the webpage, the side bar has moved lower on the page. I tried many different thing to fix it but was unsure where I went wrong. I did this to the best of my knowlege but was unsure with certain codes and attributes.
