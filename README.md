# repo-2
Module 1 - code refactor lesson

## Installation
In the challenge I had to correct code errors such as semantics, broken links, formatting etc. By doing this  it allowed me to improve the general code and clean up the current file structure. I did this to the best of my knowlege but was unsure with certain codes and attributes.

This is a simple non responsive webpage which gives information on subjects such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, Social Media Marketing, and also has a side bar to the right of the page which explains Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Managment.

## Credits
